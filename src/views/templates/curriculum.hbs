    <h1>What to Expect</h1>

    <p>
      Each student at CoderDojo is different and works at their own pace. Software development and creative fields cover <em>such</em> a broad range of topics - ranging from animal sprites all the way to the digital logic of zeroes and ones. The curriculum guide below is just that - <em>a guide</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although each programming concept below is designed to take a day, it might not take you all day. Everyone moves at their own pace, so do you! We'll be there to support you along the way.

    <h1>Scratch</h1>

    <p>
      If this is your first time programming, we suggest you get your start in a drag-and-drop programming tool called Scratch. You can <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted" target="_blank">get started with a tutorial</a>. Just press play!
    </p>

    <p>
      If this is your first day at CoderDojo, but you've done some programming before and don't know where to start, raise your hand. A mentor can guide you through your own thought process. Alternatively, you can build something according to <a href="today.html">today's theme</a> in Scratch.

    <h1>Start Programming</h1>

    <p>
      If you really want to start programming, you're going to need to start <em>writing code</em> instead of dragging blocks around. Scratch teaches the concepts of programming - conditionals, loops, and blocks - and the following sites below implement those concepts in text.

    <h2>Code Combat</h2>

    <p>
      Crawl, fight, and puzzle your way through Kithgard Dungeon, the first level of Code Combat! You can learn either Python or JavaScript and hack, dart, slash, and cast your way to victory!

    <h2>Get an IDE</h2>

    <p>
      As you get more comfortable writing code, you're going to need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE is like a text editor, except it highlights syntax, makes it easier to integrate your code into a project, and provides small hints and suggestions within your development environment. Codeanywhere is an editor just like the ones the pros use - and you can use it anywhere! You'll need to create an account to get started.
