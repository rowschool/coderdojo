    <h1>What to Expect</h1>

    <p>
      Each student at CoderDojo is different and works at their own pace. Software development and creative fields cover <em>such</em> a broad range of topics - ranging from animal sprites all the way to the digital logic of zeroes and ones. The curriculum guide below is just that - <em>a guide</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although each programming concept below is designed to take a day, it might not take you all day. Everyone moves at their own pace, so do you! We'll be there to support you along the way.

      If this is your first time programming, we suggest you get your start in a drag-and-drop programming tool called Scratch. You can <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted" target="_blank">get started with a tutorial</a>. Just press play!

      As you get better at Scratch and start presenting, you can progress along the way toward <a href="mastery.html">mastery</a>. Collect badges and acclaim as you master concepts and travel the path!

      If this is your first day at CoderDojo, but you've done some Scratch or other programming before and don't know where to start, you can explore some more options below or alternatively, raise your hand. A mentor can guide you through your own thought process.

    <h1>Start Programming</h1>

    <p>
      If you really want to start programming, you're going to need to start <em>writing code</em> instead of dragging blocks around. Scratch teaches the concepts of programming - conditionals, loops, and blocks - and the following sites below implement those concepts in text.

    <h2>Get an IDE</h2>

    <p>
      As you get more comfortable writing code, you're going to need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE is like a text editor, except it highlights syntax, makes it easier to integrate your code into a project, and provides small hints and suggestions within your development environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Codeanywhere is an editor just like the ones the pros use - and you can use it anywhere! You'll need to create an account to get started.
