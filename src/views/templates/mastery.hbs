    <h1>What to Expect</h1>

    <p>
      Each student at CoderDojo is different and works at their own pace. Software development and creative fields cover <em>such</em> a broad range of topics - ranging from animal sprites all the way to the digital logic of zeroes and ones. The mastery guide below is just that - <em>a guide</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each programming concept below is designed to take a day, but it might not take you all day. Everyone moves at their own pace, so do you! We'll be there to support you along the way. To start learning Scratch, check out the Raspberry Pi Foundation's own <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo/35" target="_blank">beginner, intermediate, and advanced tutorials</a>, called sushi cards.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you complete a project for mastery, talk to a mentor, who will take a look at your project and make sure it passes the requirements for that level. Then present your project to level up!
