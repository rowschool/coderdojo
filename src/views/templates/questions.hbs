          Children aged 7â€“17 are welcome. If a child is aged 13 or younger, their parent or guardian must be in the building throughout the entire session.

        <td>
          If your child is younger than 7 years old but is able to fluently read, they can attend the session. This is because coding is mostly built on reading and language comprehension skills.
