      CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focus on self-led learning, peer learning, and youth mentoring. We aim to help young people realize that they can build a positive future through coding and community.
