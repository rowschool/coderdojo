  <div class="content-box">
    <h1>Today's Agenda</h1>

    <p>
      Today's theme is <span class="today-theme">Halloween!</span> If you're going to be presenting your project today, it should have features related to today's theme.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be sure to follow along by paying attention to the presenting mentor.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h1>Build Projects</h1>

    <p>
      <em>
        What do I want to build today?
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      That's the first question you'll ask if you're not sure what you want to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need help, raise your hand to ask a mentor or visit <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all" target="_blank">Scratch's Projects page</a> for some inspiration!
    </p>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h1>Presentation Sign-Ups</h1>

    <p>
      At 11:00, we will make an announcement for students who want to present to line up by the Presentation Mentor and their laptop. Give them your name, the name of your project, a public link to your project (if it's in Scratch) or another way to access it (if you're using another language), and get ready!
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Please note:</strong> Presentations should be on-theme and cannot have any politics, violence, gore, or bad words (that includes "sucks!").
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h1>Presentations</h1>

    <p>
      Students should close their laptops and give their full attention to ninjas who are presenting today.
    </p>

    <p>
      For parents/guardians with tight schedules, we ask that you leave before or after presentations, but not during so we don't interrupt presenters.
